## geoJSON data for cities

### Source: [Open Street Map](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/)

Data is being consolidated in geoJSON format to serve from a static url since openstreetmap generates a dynamic query output (with the &format=json parameter) for Google maps APIv3 function through CORS for overlay of city boundaries.

// map.data.loadGeoJson()

NOTE! This is in a conceptual phase and will be regularly updated with the progress and the final outcome.
